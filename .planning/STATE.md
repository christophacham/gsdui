## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 4 phases at coarse granularity -- backend state engine first, then pipeline frontend, then terminal system, then multi-user/production
- Roadmap: Phase 3 (Terminal) depends only on Phase 1, enabling parallel execution with Phase 2 if desired

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Research flag: gray_matter crate viability for frontmatter parsing is LOW confidence -- may need regex-based extractor
- Research flag: GSD file format specification needs precise documentation from actual GSD output during Phase 1 planning
- Research flag: xterm.js addon version compatibility with @xterm/xterm 6.0 needs verification before Phase 3
